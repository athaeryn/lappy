My MacBook tweets. This is the second attempt at this actually. If you look at
his old tweets they're quite... repetitive. At first it was just a mad libs
sort of deal, then I was using a *very* simple context free grammar to generate
"sentences."

The new approach is (currently) to get the links from the Computer article on
Wikipedia and article hop a few times until finally grabbing random words off
the page and throwing them together in to a sentence.

## AUTHORIZING TWITTER

You must have a file called `auth.yml` in the base directory of the project.

It should look like this:

    ---
    :consumer_key: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV
    :consumer_secret: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZYXWVUTSRQPONML
    :oauth_token: 123456789-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ12345678909876
    :oauth_token_secret: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPENISUVWXYZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJI

NOTE: THESE ARE NOT REAL KEYS YOU HAVE TO FIND YOUR OWN
